UniMap is a Unified Framework for the evaluation and optimization of application mapping algorithms for Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, developed by me, [Ciprian Radu](http://webspace.ulbsibiu.ro/ciprian.radu/), researcher at ["Lucian Blaga" University](http://www.ulbsibiu.ro) of Sibiu, Romania. The main benefits of this framework are:

  * the comparison of algorithms on the same NoC design;
  * the evaluation of application mapping algorithms' performance, on different NoC architectures (e.g.: since such algorithms are mainly evaluated on 2D mesh NoCs, other topologies may also be tested);
  * the potential optimization of an algorithm on a particular NoC;
  * the possibility of identifying which is the most suitable application mapping algorithm for a specific NoC design.

You are welcome to use UniMap in your own research. The only requirement is to cite my [PhD thesis](http://webspace.ulbsibiu.ro/ciprian.radu/publications.html#phdThesis), for which I created this framework.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this framework.
